# Teach Yourself Code

- A free platform for learning programming that curates tutorials from Youtube; the main value propositions are that...

1. Users will be able to watch videos with minimal distraction/in a 'focus' mode
2. Users will be able to 'subscribe' to tutorials/save them to their profile
3. Users will be able to add notes to each video

- Currently being built with Next.js (React), Redux, Postgres, Hasura Engine, Apollo-GraphQL, Bulma, and Auth0.

Priority TODOS:
